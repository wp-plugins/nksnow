Snowflakes falling down your blog! Inspired by the unforgettable xsnow.

== Description ==

Snowflakes falling down your blog! Inspired by the unforgettable xsnow. Future releases will include nicer snowflakes, trees, and santa of course! <br />
Actually, I think I will hate sites using this plugin, but I had the idea and was kind of bored.<br />
You can limit the plugin to specific posts or pages. If you enter something into the URI field you will only see snow if the URI of your page matches the string. No fancy regexps. I added this feature specifically so that I could put a <a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/nksnow/">live demo</a> on my blog.

== Installation ==
<ol>
<li>Unzip nksnow.zip</li>
<li>Upload nksnow to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Configure as you like</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

== Screenshots ==
1. It's snowing ;-) See live at <a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/nksnow/">my blog</a>
2. Settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: I installed your plugin but there is no snow!!!<br />
A: You missed step 4 of the install, you need to configure the plugin.<br />

Q: I did that but there's still no snow.<br />
A: Please send me a link to your blog. It's quite possible that some doctype combinations will not work with this plugin on Internet Explorer. If somebody complains I might try to fix it.<br />

== Compatibility ==
I only use wordpress 2.6, so I haven't tested the plugin with older installs yet. Please tell me if you use it successfully on older blogs.
