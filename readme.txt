Snowflakes falling down your blog! Inspired by the unforgettable xsnow.

== Description ==

<p>
Snowflakes falling down your blog! Inspired by the unforgettable xsnow. Future releases will include nicer snowflakes, trees, and santa of course!
</p>
<p>
You can configure the number of snowflakes and limit the plugin to specific posts or pages.
If you enter something into the URI field you will only see snow if the URI of your page matches the string.
No fancy regexps.
I added this feature so that I could put a <a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/nksnow/">live demo</a> on my blog.
</p>

== Installation ==
<ol>
<li>Unzip nksnow.zip</li>
<li>Upload nksnow to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Configure as you like</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

== Screenshots ==
1. It's snowing! Watch the <a href="http://www.nkuttler.de/nksnow/">live demo</a> at my blog.
2. Settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: I see no snow.<br />
A: Please send me a link to your blog. It's quite possible that some doctype combinations or browsers will not work. If somebody complains I might try to fix it.<br />

Q: Why don't you have nicer snowflakes?<br />
A: Sorry, I'm not a designer. Feel free to send me more properly licensed snowflakes that I can include.<br />

== Compatibility ==
I only use wordpress 2.6, so I haven't tested the plugin with older installs yet. Please tell me if you use it successfully on older blogs. I got reports that the plugin doesn't work on 2.5, it's on my todo list.
